Dear Mr. Hong,


I would like to apply for the Software Engineering position in the HYS corporation. I am a Dongguk University graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer　Engineering, and I am proficient with Java, C, C++, Unix, Linux and HTML/Internet.

I have always had a keen interest in engineering which influenced my decision to study computer engineering at the university and took part as an assistant in the lab. As a computer lab assistant, I have assisted students with programming and software questions, and supported them with a variety of internally developed programs and tools. Also in my internship in ALG.corp, I participated as a team member of the Open Enterprise Solutions Group, and tested enhancements to A+ software for distributed systems management. I was also able to develop a prototype of the new product enhancement for A+ which serves as an extension of the off-site system management modeling tool. Moreover, serving as the departmental Linux Systems Administrator, I have handled many different situations. So I was able to develop my leadership skills by delegating the appropriate roles and responsibilities to each team member, ensuring the team would successfully reach our aims and objectives. 

I have many skills which I am able to contribute to the job role. My good communication skills (both written and verbal) allow me to interact with members of an organization from all levels. I have developed my public speaking and presentation skills through completing university presentations to new and prospective students and to my faculty department. I guess am organised, efficient and strive to complete any challenge given to me to the highest standard. I feel that I am a candidate suited for this position.

Attached is a copy of my CV. I look forward to hearing from you. 


Yours lovingly, 

Ashley Ko
